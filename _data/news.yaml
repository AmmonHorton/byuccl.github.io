- event_name: LANSCE Radiation Testing
  date: 2019-10-14
  description: >
    Students from the CCL traveled to the [Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE)](https://lansce.lanl.gov) to evaluate their work on computer reliability in harsh radiation environments. LANSCE provides an accelerated neutron source that mirrors the atmospheric neutron radiation found here on Earth. Several experiments were conducted accross a dozen different boards (left). Some experiments quantified improvements in reliability gained from using structural reduncancy (multiple copies to mask or detect an error) and automated software fault tolerance techniques. Another experiment targeted multi-cell upset detection. A final experiment evaluated novel configuration scrubbing techniques. Busy at the beam, students and adviors alike tended experiments and analyzed data in a remote data room (center). While things were running smoothly, a visit was made to the nearby [Bandelier National Monument](https://www.nps.gov/band/index.htm) (right).

- event_name: PYNQ PRIO Full Integration
  date: 2019-10-08
  description: >
    After continued collaboration between the PRIO team and the Xilinx PYNQ team a new PYNQ release has been announced. A new feature of this release is Device Tree Overlay support, allowing users to insert and remove Kernel drivers at will. The addition of this feature is a result of collaboration between the Xilinx PYNQ team and the BYU CCL PRIO team. This landmark represents the complete integration of PRIO into the PYNQ project. The announcement for this PYNQ release can be found [here](https://discuss.pynq.io/t/pynq-v2-5-glasgow-release/541) and the corresponding PRIO release can be found [here](https://discuss.pynq.io/t/device-tree-overlay-example/543).

- event_name: PYNQ Utah Release
  date: 2019-02-22
  description: >
    After almost a year of direct collaboration with BYU CCL students the Xilinx PYNQ team has released a new PYNQ image. One of the featured improvements for this release is new Partial Reconfiguration functionality, a direct result of the collaboration between the PYNQ team and PRIO team. In conjunction with this release the BYU CCL also released a new pip installable python package, complete with a full suite of examples demonstrating this functionality. The release was given the name Utah as a reflection of the contributions made by the PRIO team. The announcement for this PYNQ release can be found [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/embed/#!topic/pynq_project/Ik0YocHpxhU) and the corresponding PRIO release [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/embed/#!topic/pynq_project/mCwADnkv72A).
